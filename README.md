# hello-world
I'm just a poor repository, from a poor family.


Hullo, My poor family turned me out. My mom nick named me fancy and she asked that I not let her down.
From there I became obsessed with money, money was always on my mind. I go to AA for my addiction to gin and juice.
When I lay down, I put your picture away. I can't look at you when I'm lying next to him.
But it'll be okay, because through it all, my heart will go on.
